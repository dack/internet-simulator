# Internet Simulator
An application that regurgitates data from the internet from multiple and random sources and displays it to the user.
Allows you to do menial tasks like comment, like, post, swipe, share with infinite scrolling.

Also, using Python3 because I am stuck in 2.7 and end of support is nearing.
